#,gotcha,description
1,no quotes,most values are strings and without quotes only the first word remains
2,no section,rememer: stitch falls back to hardcoded options if none are speficied
3,no result,a 0-byte artifact file may result in an empty element
4,wrong art,if output is absent check the right `what` is in `inc`
5,cb is skipped,probably because it it not recognized as such: check your markdown
6,pdf fails,image files that are invalid may break your pdf-engine
