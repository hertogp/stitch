# id0 wget

The codeblock below:

- downloads a CVS-file from iana and prints it to stdout
- stdout is redirected to a file
- includes itself in a fenced codeblock (`cbx:fcb`)
- includes the stdout file and shows its data in a codeblock  (`out`)
- includes stdout data after reading it with pandoc's csv-reader (`out!csv`)
- includes the same, but dumps AST in native form in a codeblock (`out!csv:fcb`)
- lastly, there is no output on stderr, so nothing will be included there

```{#id0 .stitch old=remove caption="IPv4 special registry" inc="cbx:fcb out:fcb out!csv, out!csv:fcb err"}
#! /usr/bin/env bash
wget -q https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/prime-generator-pairs.csv -O -
```

# id1 echo

```{#id1 .stitch exe=yes cfg=missing arg="cli args here" inc="out:fcb"}
#! /usr/bin/env bash
echo "Hello, world!"
echo script name    $0
echo argument array $@
echo last argument  ${@: -1}
```
