The codeblock below:

- downloads a CVS-file from iana and prints it to stdout
- stdout is redirected to a file
- includes itself in a fenced codeblock (`cbx:fcb`)
- includes the stdout file and shows its data in a codeblock  (`out`)
- includes stdout data after reading it with pandoc's csv-reader (`out!csv`)
- includes the same, but dumps AST in native form in a codeblock (`out!csv:fcb`)
- lastly, there is no output on stderr, so nothing will be included there

```{#id0 .stitch old=remove caption="IPv4 special registry" inc="cbx:fcb out:fcb out!csv, out!csv:fcb err"}
